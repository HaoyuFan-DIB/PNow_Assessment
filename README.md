# PNow_Assessment
The coding assessment for PNow internship. I will be using the stellar parameter data set and predict the temperature of stellar objects from their brightness and colors. The key aspects of this projects include:
- Feature engineering and EDA report while preparing the data;
- Train the model using `lightGBM` framework;
- Turn the pipeline into a distributed version using `Dask` or `Ray`;
- Share the results with colleagues at PNow.

I will continuously updating this repo as the project goes and finger crossed!
